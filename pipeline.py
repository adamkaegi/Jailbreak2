"""Builds the LangChain pipeline that turns one prompt into one model response.

LangChain's "LCEL" (LangChain Expression Language) composes steps with the `|`
operator, like piping shell commands. Every step is a `Runnable` — an object
with `.invoke(x)` that takes one value and returns the next one. `a | b`
gives you a new Runnable that feeds `a`'s output straight into `b`.

Our chain, left to right:

    attack -> [input-stage defenses] -> prompt template -> model -> text parser -> [output-stage defenses]

- `attack.apply` and `defense.apply` are plain Python functions (see
  attacks/base.py, defenses/base.py). Wrapping them in `RunnableLambda` is
  what lets them sit in the `|` chain alongside LangChain's own components.
- `ChatPromptTemplate` turns `{"text": "..."}` into the list of chat messages
  the model expects.
- `ChatOllama` is the actual LLM call.
- `StrOutputParser` unwraps the model's reply object down to a plain string.

Each defense declares a `stage` ("input" or "output"), so adding or removing
a defense never requires touching this file — it just gets spliced in at the
matching point.
